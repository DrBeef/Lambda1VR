HALF-LIFE OVERHAUL PACK v1.0 by Qwertyus

I. INTRODUCTION.

Half-Life Overhaul Pack - it's a high-quality replacement pack for the original Half-Life models and sounds. As fan of singleplayer episodes I played a lot of the Half-Life mods, and all about improving of the playing experience were always interesting for me. So I made this package that can be used not only to play Half-Life as it is, but for playing different Half-Life maps and mods (especially singleplayer) too. Models and sounds included in this pack are not only my personal work. I'm only tried to gather some amazing elements made by other people, edit these elements and create new stylish replacement pack. I also had the task to save full functionality and classic style of original Valve's models for all of their replacements and don't forget to improve and fix all I can.

P. S. My English is not perfect, but I hope this will not be a great problem for you :) .

III. TERMS OF USE.

This Overhaul Pack package is an unofficial, non-commercial, freely available add-on for the Half-Life game by Valve Sofware. Overhaul Pack is a product of joint creation of many independent authors (listed above). Final assembly and completion of the contents of this package made by me (Qwertyus). All rights to this or that part of the contents of the Overhaul Pack are owned directly by their respective autors. Prohibited any commercial use of any part of this product without the consent of all right-holders. You have the right solely to the private use of the contents of this package for purposes not related to the recovery of profits. Overhaul Pack must be distributed in full source form with this document attached. If you wish to modify any part of the package contents and / or distribute it separately, you must accompany the file with accurate information about all the respective autors, who took part in creating of that content. By installing this package on your computer, you accept full responsibility for its' using on yourself. This package has been thoroughly tested on only one separate computer (mine), so I do not give you any guarantee of efficiency, performance, compatibility and security of the contents of Overhaul Pack for your computer, installed on it software and possible conditions of their use. Also, I do not guarantee any support for users of this package on emerging issues or any difficulties you might have with its' using. All the most important and necessary information about the package contained in this document, so it is advisable to read it carefully and return to reading if you have found any problem.

IV. REQUIREMENTS.

Overhaul Pack should run properly on any full version of the Half-Life, if it supports with latest versions of the rendering libraries (cg.dll, cgGL.dll, hw.dll, sw.dll). You should have these libraries installed for the proper displaying of the additive textures, because many models from this package contains them. Latest WON version (1.1.1.0) or Steam version (1.1.1.1 and above) of the Half-Life are most recommended. Latest releases of the Xash3D engine (0.90 at this moment) must be compatible also (without the need to use any Half-Life rendering libraries).

If you have any troubles with rendering of additive textures, try to download and use dlls from here:
http://www.gamefront.com/files/2308037/New_render_dll_s_for_Half_Life

In addition to the latest version of the game you must have a sufficiently powerful PC. Overhaul Pack contains a lot of models with high-resolution textures, so you may have a problems with low in-game performance on a low-end PC.

V. INSTALLING

For easy installing ang testing this package was released as Half-Life modification, stored in separate directory. You should only unpack an "Overhaul" folder from downloaded archive into the Half-Life main directory and run it as any custom third-party mod for Half-Life. If you have a WON version of the game you can use "Custom game" menu to activate the package as stand-alone modification. Steam users should extract "Overhaul" folder in "...\Steam\SteamApps\<youraccount>\half-life\" and restart Steam before running the game. You can also create a shortcut to run the Half-Life with Overhaul Pack, just use "-game Overhaul" key (without brackets) after hl.exe (or after hl.exe") in the shortcut's Object box. If you are Steam user try key "-steam -appid 70 -game Overhaul" (without brackets) if "-game Overhaul" is not enough to run the mod.

If you really like the Overhaul Pack and want to use all of its' content as permanent replacement pack when playing any Half-Life mod (if possible), then select and copy all folders ("gfx", "models", "resource", "sound" and "sprites") from "Overhaul" directory to "valve" and replace any original files if prompted. If you using any localised Steam version of Half-Life (russian, for example), you can put the contents of Overhaul Pack to localised "valve" folder ("valve_russian", for example) instead of main folder, and game will primarily read all files from there.

VI. FEATURES.

For the Overhaul Pack were selected a lot of models and sounds from all possible sources: single releases, model packs and mods by different autors. Most sounds included in this package were kept unchanched, except of some bug and compatibility fixes.

Note: any multiplayer models for the players were not included in the current version of the package.

Specific changes that were made:
- A lot of high-quality textures were selected or created for the models in this pack. Many models improved in looks by using some elements with an additive textures for cool visual effects. 
- UV maps of the modified models were optimized for their textures with all possible precision. UV maps of v_-models optimized for using H4wK's sleeve and edited DiamonD's glove Hi-Res H.E.V. textures, but you can also try another alternative textures, best of them are included in this pack ("HEV skins" folder). Use Jed's Half-Life Model Viewer "Import texture" and "Save model" features for easy replacing!
- All models with external textures / animations files (such as *01.mdl or *T.mdl) were recompiled in one file.
- Combined animations (and model parts, if needed) from Half-Life and Opposing Force models for barney.mdl, gman.mdl, headcrab.mdl, islave.mdl and skeleton.mdl. So you can use these models as replacement for corresponding OF models. OF anims are also included in loader.mdl and scientist.mdl, but these models are not totally suitable for OF-based mods. Loader.mdl in OF use different texture of the box. This texture is included in the model as alternative skin, but it will not appear in game itself without editing (Model Viewer can help you here). Scientist.mdl can't be properly used because two additional heads (Walter with clipboard and Slick with stick) are not included (I tried to use them for HL model too, but I've got a problem with "needle" appearance in normal HL game). The second small problem of scientist.mdl - additional animations for it are based on Gearbox's HD-model and some of them are not identical to the animations from the Gearbox's low definiton model ("cpr_gesture1", "cpr_gesture2" and "of1_a1_cpr2" sequences are not correctly animated). So additional OF animations in scientist.mdl can be interesting for modmakers only, as I think.
- Additional animations needed for playing Blue Shift (or Blue Shift based mods) are also included in barney.mdl, hgrunt.mdl, houndeye.mdl and zombie.mdl.
- Restored original animations / hitboxes (based on Valve's non-HD models) for chumtoad.mdl, construction.mdl, hassault.mdl, holo.mdl, osprey.mdl, skeleton.mdl, v_satchel_radio.mdl and for some of p_ and w_-models. In holo.mdl also added "pushcart" sequence from Blue Shift low definition model (it's an unused animation, it can be interesting for modmakers only).
- Restored removable night vision googles for hassassin.mdl and original Valve's "death_during_run" sequence (Romka's animation preserved too as random replacement for it). Also added "germandeath" sequence from Decay model and "yes" sequence from Azure Sheep model.
- Restored / added some original animations instead of HD-type for hgrunt.mdl ("run", "flinch" and "idle" sequences).
- Added some animations (from different HL mods) as random replacement of original "walk" and "victorydance" sequences for hgrunt.mdl.
- Added a bunch of ragdoll animations (thanks to "Arrange Mod: Rebirth" team and Gman) as random replacement of original "die" sequences for barney.mdl and hgrunt.mdl (original animations were preserved also).
- Corrected speed of animations for many models in accordance with Valve's low definition models, mostly for NPCs and v_-models (because this can be important for the scripted sequences and for preserving of the original gameplay style).
- v_9mmAR.mdl, v_9mmhandgun.mdl, v_357.mdl, v_crossbow.mdl, v_gauss.mdl, v_shotgun.mdl, v_grenade.mdl rigged on alternative or fixed animations.
- Added special sounds for "draw" sequences of all v_-models, some new sounds added for other sequences.
- Restored "silencer" attachment for v_9mmhandgun.mdl (rarely used in mods, not in original game) and "scope" attachment for v_357.mdl (appears in multiplayer game).
- Additional type of heads added in holo.mdl, player.mdl, w_suit.mdl and hassault.mdl. They will not appear in game, but maybe some modmakers will use this idea.
- Additional skins added directly in apache.mdl and gman.mdl. They will not appear in game, use Model Viewer to check and customize them.
- w_adrenaline.mdl, w_antidote.mdl, w_rad.mdl, w_security.mdl, w_isotopebox.mdl - these models were converted with some editing from their original sources to create a good replacement for corresponding Half-Life models at first time.

VII. COMPATIBILITY & KNOWN PROBLEMS.

Overhaul Pack was designed as universal replacement pack Half-Life (like HD-pack by Gearbox), and if its' content will be placed in "valve" folder, it will be used by other Half-Life mods too (if they only haven't their own models for replacement included). Models from this package can also be used as replacement for some models from different singleplayer Half-Life modifications, but this option is only for experienced peoples. Do it with caution, creating a backup copies of original files before replacing is strongly recomended. Models for replacement must have not only the identical file names with originals, they must have the identical gameplay functionality (all needed animation sequences, body parts and submodels compiled in right order, etc). Wrong replacement can disrupt normal gameplay or even cause game crashes.

Overhaul Pack (moved in the "valve" folder as permanent replacement for all original files) was tested by playing throughout whole Half-Life and many of the singleplayer maps and modifications, including:

Playing the wide range of maps and mods was helpful to finding some hidden problems in early Overhaul Pack content. All known for me critical bugs, which can interrupt normal gameplay (especially in models and animations) were fixed. But you still have a chance, that in some situations you can encounter another specific problems that was not known for me. If you see any bug, for example - not worked scripted sequence - try to replay this episode with original models by Valve or by the autors of modification. If this bug appears frequently and ONLY with the Overhaul Pack content, please let me know about this in details (what mod you have played and how exactly problem happened).

Here are some known for me problems that can't be properly solved at the moment (but they are not so terrible and they can occure not only with the Overhaul Pack content):
- Depending on version of hl.dll or client.dll (or another dlls, used by mods) you may have some problems with in-game animation of v_-models. Although all v_-models in the package have properly animated "idle" and "fidget" sequences, some of them can't be played (so the weapons looks like "freezed" or only one of possible "idle" / "fidget" sequences works). It's not an error of the Overhaul Pack, it's an error of used dll.
- Most part of sounds included in the Overhaul Pack were saved in higher quality format (44100 Hz instead of 11025 Hz, for example) and in some situations WON version of the game can't play a separate sound properly ("runtime sample conversion" error). Rarely game (Steam version too) can stop playing other sounds also, for example scientists' (or guards') speeches. After level change this problem should disappear.
- Additive textures on models look cool, but Gold Source engine have some glitches with their using. So sometimes in game you can see a grid with triangles over surface of some other textures on the model with any additive texture (it's like a disappearing of the smoothing effect). This problem is fixed for most of my models, but not in hgrunt.mdl - these "triangles" you can see on the weapons of a soldiers in masks (because of additive glass texture used there and specific model assembly). This problem appears only when a weapon is in a soldier's hands. Xash3D engine have no this limitation.
- Rarely additive textures of some models can work as an ordinary textures, without glowing and lucid effects (for example, some dead grunts in "DAV Train" mission and almost all enemies on the second map of the "Echo Transit" mission in "Reissues" have this problem). Under Xash3D engine this glitch do not appear, as I know.
- In some situations (depending on specific map lighting etc.) additive textures also can partially lose their glowing and lucid effects or became almost totally transparent instead. Same problems can happen when some models appears in game as semi-transparent (for example, assassins in "stealth" mode or any "hologrammed" model) - some elements or textures can look wrong on a model. It's a restriction of the graphic engine too.
- Sometimes scripted sequences don't work properly with modified models because of hidden problems in animations (or because of wrong animation speed, etc). For example, I managed to solve a problems of barney.mdl (Barney stuck behind the osprey in the final of "Times of Troubles"), hgrunt.mdl (soldier with shotgun stuck in the lift in "E.T.C.") and gman.mdl (GMan prevent the closing of the secret entrance door in "Loki's Missions: The Xeno Project"; although I found a decision, sometimes this bug still can happen). Note for the modelmakers - after decompiling these models and new recompiling bug can appear again. And of course any of modified models may not work exactly as original, especially in modifications, just remember it. Hopefully, more often another circumstances can cause problems with scripts, and all you need is load your game from one of saved points and try an alternative way.
- Because of additional "ragdoll" death animations was added for barney.mdl and hgrunt.mdl you can see a wrong positions of dead bodies if you save a game with the Overhaul Pack models, and then load this game without them.
- Sometimes grunts don't drop their weapons after death (because of contact with obstacles death animation can be stopped before the moment when weapon must be dropped). Then you can see this weapon in the right hand of a soldier. As I know, this problem also can happen with standard Valve's models too. To get a weapon simply smash the soldier's body into gibs with your crowbar or grenade.
